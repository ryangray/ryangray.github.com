{"tagline":"Where the bits left over from Twitter and Tumblr go","body":"# Huh?\r\n\r\nWell, I'm trying to understand Github Pages. So far, I've got the repo created with the right name, and I've chosen Automatic Pages in the admin, and I'm editing this, in what I think is the `README.md` file. I'll pick a theme and then press on and see what I get.\r\n\r\nI don't know if `README.md` is the main page, or if it is only when using auto generated pages, or only if there's no `index` file.\r\n\r\nI will also have to figure out how I add pages. Do I have to do that in a working copy, or can I also do that though the website?\r\n\r\nContent later.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
